# Repository Guidelines

- Use modern ES modules with explicit named exports when possible.
- Prefer two-space indentation and include semicolons in JavaScript files.
- Keep helper utilities near the logic that consumes them; avoid scattering related helpers across multiple modules unless they are reused widely.
- Keep styles in `src/style.css` scoped using class names or element selectors that already exist.
